# Document Classification using VGG-16

Thank you for your interest in my multi-class classification project, which aims to accurately categorize images into one of 16 document categories, such as letter, form, email, and more. The dataset consists of a large number of images accompanied by their corresponding category labels, represented by numerical values in a CSV file.

To address this task, I employed the popular technique of transfer learning, specifically utilizing the pre-trained VGG-16 model, a convolutional neural network widely used for image classification tasks. I leveraged this pre-trained model by freezing its layers and adding more custom layers on top of it to develop a total of three models.

By implementing this transfer learning approach, I was able to achieve an impressive accuracy rate of 73% in my multi-class classification model.
